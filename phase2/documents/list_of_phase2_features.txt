=========================================
List of features implemented for Phase 2
=========================================

Mandatory extensions:

- Gave admins ability to undo every action taken by normal users that can reasonably be undone
    > un-send a trade request for any user
    > retract the approval of any user's item -- this will also remove all trade requests involving the item

- Automatic suggestion of items to lend to a given user
    > when setting up a trade request, the suggested items will appear on the side so the user can see them while choosing an item from their inventory to lend
    > will suggest any of the user's own items that are either directly on the other user's wishlist or share the same name as an item on their wishlist

- New type of account that allows a user to look at the various parts of the program without being able to trade or communicate with the admins
    > access this "account" by choosing to demo the program from the start menu

- Let admins adjust all of the threshold values from inside the program or through text file thresholds.txt

- Created a new status for normal users that allows them to take their account down for the duration of a vacation
    > their account will be invisible to other users
    > their account's functionality is limited to changing their status back to 'not on vacation' and viewing notifications

Extensions chosen from given list:

- Made users enter their home city when creating an account, so that the system will only show them items from other users in the same city

- Replaced our text UI with a GUI
    > Java Swing

Our own new features:

- Created a notification system for normal users, where notifications are generated by:
    > certain actions/inaction from another user (i.e. a trade partner or an admin), or
    > certain actions/inaction done by the user themself

    ------------------------------------------------
    Actions that create a notification for a user A:
    ------------------------------------------------

    From an admin:
    + admin approves A's pending item
    + admin rejects A's pending item
    + admin freezes A's account
    + admin accepts A's unfreeze request
    + admin changes one threshold to x for all users
    + admin undoes an action:
        > admin undoes another admin's approval for A's pending item
        > admin un-sends A's trade request

    -------------------------------------------------------------------

    From another user B:
    + B sends A a trade request
    + B accepts a trade request from A
    + B rejects a trade request from A
    + B cancels a trade with A
    + B edits the meeting details of an ongoing trade with A
    + B agrees with a meeting suggested by A
    + B confirms a transaction before A
    + B confirms a permanent trade transaction after A
    + B confirms a temporary trade's first transaction after A
    + B confirms a temporary trade's second transaction after A

    -------------------------------------------------------------------

    From A's own actions:
    + A and/or their trade partner B fail to confirm transaction on time (notification sent to both A and B)
    + A exceeds their incomplete trade limit
    + A goes on vacation
    + A comes back from vacation

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    - init admin creates new admin (only recorded in activity log)
