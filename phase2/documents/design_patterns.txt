Design Patterns used
====================

Observer Design Pattern
    Classes involved: NotificationSystem, User (and its subclasses NormalUser/AdminUser), and UserNotificationHelper
        We used the observer design pattern to help create notifications for normal users and log user activity by making the
    NotificationSystem class implement the Observer interface and making the User class extend Observable.
    Then, we made sure that all Users in the system are observed by the same instance of NotificationSystem.
        The observer design pattern was chosen because it allows NotificationSystem to receive updates and record user activity
    without User and NotificationSystem knowing anything about each other, leading to lower coupling in the design.
    This means User can notify objects without assuming that they are a NotificationSystem—it could be any Observer, which makes the program more extensible.

    This design pattern also encapsulates the cause—a certain action done by a user in the program—from its effect, which includes:
        a) decisions on who gets notified and whether or not to record the action in the activity log,
        b) creation of a notification about the action and storing it in a list of notifications mapped to the username of the account being notified, and
        c) making a matching entry for it in the activity log.

        An extra class called UserNotificationHelper was added to separate out the methods that organize the information
    needed for creating the correct notification corresponding to a user action.

Strategy Design Pattern
    Classes involved: ConfirmAndClosePermTrade and ConfirmAndCloseTempTrade
        We implemented these classes without the strategy pattern that uses an interface, but they are still
    two classes specifically made to store different algorithms that serve a similar purpose.
    ConfirmAndClosePermTrade and ConfirmAndCloseTempTrade confirm the final transaction for a trade and close it if both users involved
    have confirmed that transaction. They were separated into different "strategies" because the things that happen at the end
    of a permanent trade aren't the same as the things that happen at the end of a temporary trade.
        Using the strategy design pattern separates these algorithms from the class they are used in (OngoingTradesViewer), so we
    could easily reuse them in another class if we wanted to in the future. It also encapsulates the algorithms being used in classes
    that facilitate the confirmation and closing of trades.

Facade Design Pattern
    Classes involved: SystemPresenter (the facade class); NormalDashPresenter, AdminDashPresenter, DemoDashPresenter, and ExceptionPresenter (the classes stored in the facade class)
	    The SystemPresenter class encapsulates the NormalDashPresenter, AdminDashPresenter, DemoDashPresenter, and ExceptionPresenter classes.
	We hid the more complex implementation of the presenters used for different cases in the SystemPresenter class.
	This is a direct improvement from our phase 1 code based on the feedback we got that the class SystemPresenter was too big.
	    We made SystemPresenter a facade so the existing calls to its methods do not have to change; instead, SystemPresenter will call the
	appropriate method in the appropriate presenter stored in SystemPresenter. This encapsulates the code better since the client code
	does not have direct access to the subsystem the facade contains—the client code can only communicate with the subsystem via the SystemPresenter facade.

Possible Usage of Strategy Design Pattern: 
    Classes involved: AdminDashboard and NormalDashboard 
	The two classes uses algorithms stored in other controllers rather than storing those algorithms themselves.
	For example: in the NormalDashboard class, to change the normal user's status to vacation, the NormalDashboard class calls the switchVacationStatus method
	in StatusEditor instead of modifying the NormalUser entity itself. This encapsulates the algorithm so they are not stored in the NormalDashboard class.
	This also makes the NormalDashboard class more concise and more extensible, because we can easily attach other controller classes
	to the NormalDashboard class if we were to create more functions for the NormalUser.

Another Possible Usage of Strategy Design Pattern:
    Class involved: DashFrame
	We tried to limit any type of algorithm in the DashFrame class to avoid it getting more complex then it already is.
	We did this by making most of the JButton actionlisteners a direct call to a dashboard class controller so the inputs
	can be interpreted in the dashboard controller instead of inside the DashFrame class.
